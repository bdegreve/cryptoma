Starterkit to make staticly generated websites using React and Bootstrap

## Requirements

Node.js (v4.x LTS recommended) and NPM (v3.x recommended).

- Windows: Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org). NPM is included.
- Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install nodejs-legacy npm`

## Getting started

To install all dependencies and build your static website, run this single command:

```
npm install
```

That's it! Your static website can be found in `dist/`, ready to be deployed.

Other commands:
- `npm start`: run a live development server at http://localhost:8080, usefull while developing your website.
- `npm test`: run some tests (just your codestyle for now)
